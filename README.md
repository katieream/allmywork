# Katie Ream Code for Physics Projects
This is a GitHub page combining all my previous coding projects for various research projects as well as homework submissions for my complex systems course. 

The folder titled ```Multiple Coulomb Scattering ML``` involved me crafting a convolution neural network (CNN) in order to calculate momentum of particles detected in the SBND detector at Fermilab in a more optimized manner. The tracks used were simulated data since SBND was not actively collecting data in 2023. This was my first project working with ML and relied on the ```tensorflow``` package.

The folder titled ```CMS Anomaly``` involved my work at CERN during the 2024 Summer developing anomaly detection algorithms and taking those algorithms a step further by developing a stability measurement tool that verifies whether channels are overall good or bad for a data fill in order to clean out bad data. This project relies on the ```adtk``` python package and works similarly to a ML model without actually using ML.

The folder titled ```complxsys``` contains my homework solutions as well as final project for Complex Systems 530 course taught at UMich in Winter 2025.

The folder ```paleodetectors``` involves various analyses for my work at the University of Michigan studying the rate of atmospheric neutrinos over 1 gigayear in time through measuring damage tracks left in paleodetectors, or ancient rocks buried deep below the Earth's surface. My current work involves crafting simulations for molecular dynamics analysis, which is done primarily through LAMMPS software and the OVITO interface. 

The folder ```complxsys``` contains the homework code submissions for my ComplexSys530 course taken in Winter 2025.
