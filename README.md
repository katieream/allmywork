# Katie Ream Code for Physics Projects
This is a GitHub page combining all my previous coding projects for various research projects.

The folder titled ```Multiple Coulomb Scattering ML``` involved me crafting a convolution neural network (CNN) in order to calculate momentum of particles detected in the SBND detector at Fermilab in a more optimized manner. The tracks used were simulated data since SBND was not actively collecting data in 2023. This was my first project working with ML and relied on the ```tensorflow``` package.

The folder titled ```CMS Anomaly``` involved my work at CERN during the 2024 Summer developing anomaly detection algorithms and taking those algorithms a step further by developing a stability measurement tool that verifies whether channels are overall good or bad for a data fill in order to clean out bad data. This project relies on the ```adtk``` python package and works similarly to a ML model without actually using ML.

For any questions concerning the code, reach out to kmream@umich.edu.
