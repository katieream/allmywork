# Overview

The notebook ```sbnd_b_ml``` is a convolutional neural network (CNN) type machine learning model that processes image data. It requires reading in a json file for data, however that can be modified as needed. The CNN network is written based off of the tensorflow package and uses a U-Net shaped model. The model learned in the end, however it definitely struggled due to needing further hyper-parameter tuning and also because most of the images are empty space. Thus, as a result, to improve the model even further it would be worth exploring to see if a sparse neural network (SNN) shape overall or even a couple layers added would improve learning ability of the model. 

This code was my first ML project and also my first in depth coding project, so I have learned much since working on this the summer of 2023. I would approach solving this slightly differently if given the same task now, by instead choosing to use the ```pytorch``` package instead of the ```tensorflow``` package which works much better for a SNN. I additionally would have put more focus on plotting the ROC curve rather than looking strictly at the fractional percent errors of each epoch ran. I also think I could have further cropped the images to reduce how much space the model needed to learn.

This project was completed at the University of Chicago 2023 MRSEC and Physics Summer REU program under my PI David Schmitz and graduate student Moon Jung.
